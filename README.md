# credit-risk-classification
## ANALYSIS OVERVIEW
In this credit risk classification we are using a logistic regression model that will use trained labels to make predictions on past history data to identify the credit worthiness of borrowers. With the logistic regression model we split data into binary variables where a dependent variable relies on an independent variable in order to have a test data group to then fit the model and make predictions. 
## RESULTS
Accuracy- the overall accuracy of the model was 99% which is an excellent score overall for a model. 

Precision- healthy loan was 100% which tells us that  100% of the predicted test data was a true positive. 

Precitions- high-risk loan was 85% which tells us that 85% of the predicted test data was a true positive. 

Recall- healthy loan was 99% which tells us that 99% of the overall data was correctly classified.

Recall- high-risk loan was 85% which tells us that there was some room for false negatives, but overall a high score to have 85% of the overall data to be classified correctly. 

## SUMMARY
Overall, I recommend this model to be used by the company to assess credit worthiness of borrowers. The overall high scores in each category. It tells us we overall have a good amount of true positives, meaning that the company can make a good revenue and trust in their borrowers. The 85% precision on high-risk loans leaves a window open of 15% for a mis-classification where a borrower who possibly is high risk may get approved for a loan, however the 85% of data is still relevant and should not allow the company to steer away from this model due to that.
